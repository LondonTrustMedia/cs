    - AV - Ruby Issues (Windows)
      "What your program is detecting is called rubyw.exe. This is the process that executes all the ruby scripting in our application, that allows it to run. However, we designed it to install to a randomized temporary directory on each launch, along with a randomized filename, to ensure no one can locate it, and thus crack it (while it's running, it contains your login information and binds your local IP, which would be a major security risk if it became visible externally; thus why we randomize it's name and location, so it can't be found by automatic scripts/etc). 
      
      However, this randomization causes security software to be unable to recognize it. Security software operates off of a predefined list of allowed apps, called a definition file. If it sees anything that's not on that list (even custom apps like ours), it will state it's untrusted it, and immediately assumes it's not safe (since it doesn't know what it is). This is extremely common, and is why the app developers allow you a way to add your own exceptions for apps on your computer, to allow them to function when you know they're safe. 
      
      To do this for our app, you need to add the following process exceptions to it's whitelist/allowed app list/etc, which should keep it from interfering with its operation in the future:

        Due to a new feature that Apple released in Mac OS 10.10.x (Yosemite), there have been hundreds of thousands of reports world-wide of network (especially wifi) performance issues on many services, including ours. This is due to a feature called "Apple Wireless Direct Link", which creates an extra virtual adapter on your computer that attempts to split your connection, causing performance (and in the case of VPN connections, security) issues. Apple recommends disabling this virtual adapter in the event of seeing performance issues. I'll explain how to do so below.
        
        1. Open the Terminal application on your computer.
        2. Type the following command, hitting Enter on your keyboard afterwards: sudo ifconfig awdl0 down
        
        (in the command above, that's "A-W-D-L-Zero")

          What you experienced is likely due to a DNS leak on your system. Occasionally, DNS requests can slip past the VPN, and will instead make it to your ISP's DNS servers; this will often reveal your geographic region.
          
          Avoiding this is quite simple. If you statically assign your DNS settings to use a public DNS (our DNS servers - 209.222.18.222 and 209.222.18.218), you should be able to browse again. If you require steps on how to make this change, please refer to this article:

          "Hello,
          
          Thank you for contacting us.
          
          There's a number of things that could cause your real IP to display. The most common is your browser itself. Did you connect to the VPN before you opened your browser, or afterwards? If you connect to the VPN while any instance of your browser is already open, then your browser can't rebind to TCP correctly, thus it cannot update the IP it will reflect externally. Please ensure you're connecting to the VPN before you open any internet-based application, to ensure the use (and display) the correct IP and DNS information.
          
          Next; can you submit a debug log, so we can see if there's anything happening in the back-end that might be causing the IP negotiation to fail somewhere? I'll explain how to submit a debug log below:
          
          1.  Click on the PIA application.
          2.  Click on Settings.
          3.  Click on the Advanced button.
          4.  Click into the Local Port box.
          5.  Hit CTRL+L on your keyboard.
          6.  You'll see a window pop up, asking to send a debug log, along with a 3-digit ID.
          7.  Send the debug log to us, and let us know what the ID number is.
          
          Once we receive this, we'll go over the log to see if we can identify the cause of the issues you're facing.
          
          Lastly, there's a few other pieces of info we'll need to identify the issue:
          
          -  What operating system are you running on your computer?
          -  Are you running any firewalls or other security software on your computer?
          -  How are you connecting to the internet (public wifi, you own router, an ISP's modem, etc)?
          -  How are you connecting to VPN (our PIA application, a manual setup, another application, etc)?"

          Thank you for contacting us.
          
          What you experienced is likely due to a DNS leak on your system. Occasionally, DNS requests can slip past the VPN, and will instead make it to your ISP's DNS servers; this will often reveal your geographic region.
          
          Avoiding this is quite simple. If you statically assign your DNS settings to use a public DNS (our DNS servers - 209.222.18.222 and 209.222.18.218), you should be able to browse again. If you require steps on how to make this change, please refer to this article:

          There's a number of things that could cause your real IP to display. The most common is your browser itself. Did you connect to the VPN before you opened your browser, or afterwards? If you connect to the VPN while any instance of your browser is already open, then your browser can't rebind to TCP correctly, thus it cannot update the IP it will reflect externally. Please ensure you're connecting to the VPN before you open any internet-based application, to ensure the use (and display) the correct IP and DNS information.
          
          Next; can you submit a debug log, so we can see if there's anything happening in the back-end that might be causing the IP negotiation to fail somewhere? I'll explain how to submit a debug log below:
          
          1.  Click on the PIA application.
          2.  Click on Settings.
          3.  Click on the Advanced button.
          4.  Click into the Local Port box.
          5.  Hit CTRL+L on your keyboard.
          6.  You'll see a window pop up, asking to send a debug log, along with a 3-digit ID.
          7.  Send the debug log to us, and let us know what the ID number is.
          
          Once we receive this, we'll go over the log to see if we can identify the cause of the issues you're facing.
          
          Lastly, there's a few other pieces of info we'll need to identify the issue:
          
          -  What operating system are you running on your computer?
          -  Are you running any firewalls or other security software on your computer?
          -  How are you connecting to the internet (public wifi, you own router, an ISP's modem, etc)?
          -  How are you connecting to VPN (our PIA application, a manual setup, another application, etc)?"

        Thank you for contacting us.
        
        The DNS leak protection feature activates VPN DNS leak protection. This ensures that DNS requests are routed through the VPN. This enables the greatest level of privacy and security but may cause connectivity issues in non-standard network configurations.
        
        This can be enabled and disabled in the Windows application, while it is enabled by default on our Mac OS X application.
        
        We use our own private DNS servers for your DNS queries while on the VPN. After connecting we set your operating system's DNS servers to 209.222.18.222 and 209.222.18.218. When using a DNS Leak testing site you should expect to see your DNS requests originate from the IP of the VPN gateway you are connected to.
        
        If you change your DNS servers manually or if for some other reason they are changed this does not necessarily mean your DNS is leaking. Even if you use different DNS servers the queries will still be routed through the VPN connection and will be anonymous.
        
        Here are some instructions on changing your DNS settings for various systems:

        IPv6 leak protection disables IPv6 traffic while on the VPN. This ensures that no IPv6 traffic leaks out over your normal internet connection when you are connected to the VPN. This includes 6to4 and Teredo tunneled IPv6 traffic. This will not block IPv6 on Windows XP if you have manually enabled it. "
      - Features - Enable - Killswitch
        "Hello,
        
        Thank you for contacting us.
        
        The internet kill switch feature activates VPN disconnect protection. If you disconnect from the VPN, your internet access will stop working. It will reactivate normal internet access when you deactivate the kill switch mode or exit the application.
        
        Please follow these steps to use the killswitch properly:
        
        - BEFORE connecting the VPN, check the killswitch button and save the settings
        - Connect to your chosen VPN server
        - When you are done with the VPN, disconnect first. 
        - Once disconnected, uncheck the killswitch and it will bring back your Internet connection.
        
        If your system has more than one network adapter installed (i.e. both Ethernet and Wi-Fi), then you should disable the unused adapter so the killswitch does not "kill" the incorrect connection. Even if you are not actively using this other adapter, you still must disable it.
        
        Also, there are currently known issues with users that have a default gateway starting with 10.x.x.x . These users are unable to use the kill switch. At this time the current resolution is to change your default gateway / network DHCP range in your router to 172.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255 or 192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255"

        "Hello,
        
        Thank you for contacting us.
        
        When using port forwarding, you assign ports that remain open for applications on your computer to use unrestricted. This is sometimes necessary for certain applications, so they can access their servers uninhibited (such as torrents, etc). The security risk associated with this, however, is that if in the unlikely case someone were to a) somehow know your local IP address (not the virtual IP that our VPN grants), and b) happened to be watching/scanning that IP for available open ports, then it's possible they could use one of these open ports to access/bypass the VPN tunnel, allowing access to your computer. 
        
        While it is unlikely that such would ever occur, it is still a very remote possibility, and as such, we suggest not using port forwarding if it can at all be avoided."

          "Hello,
          
          Thank you for contacting us.
          
          Upon reviewing the debug log it seems that there is something blocking the kill switch from generating the file needed to make the killswitch work. What I would like you to try is to manually create the file, and see if that gets the killswitch working for you. The steps to do this are listed below:
           
           1. Locate Notepad on your computer. Right click Notepad, and choose Run as administrator.
           2. Now locate Command Prompt on your computer, and open it.
           3. In Command Prompt, type ipconfig
           4. Press Enter
           5. Scroll to the top of the information that appeared, and look for the IPv4 address. Below that you should see your subnet mask, and below that, you should see your default gateway. The default gateway is what we need.
           
           5.1 See the attached Default Gateway screenshot in the following dropbox link below for an example.
          
          https://www.dropbox.com/s/1uubozt12niqd9d/Mac-DefaultGateway.png
           
           6. Once you have retrieved the Default Gateway, go back to Notepad, and paste the following there: {"killswitch":true,"saved_default_gateway":"x.x.x.x","saved_openvpn_gateway":null,"standard_route_removed":true,"watching_standard_route":true}
           7. Replace the x.x.x.x in the line above with your Default Gateway. It should look similar to {"killswitch":true,"saved_default_gateway":"192.168.65.1","saved_openvpn_gateway":null,"standard_route_removed":true,"watching_standard_route":true} when you are finished, but with your Default Gateway in place of the 192.168.65.1.
           8. Click File in Notepad, and click Save. In the Save window, navigate to your Program Files (not Program Files x86) folder, and locate the pia_manager folder.
           9. Open the pia_manager folder, then open the Data folder contained within.
           10. Name the file killswitch_state.json and click Save.
           
          Now try the killswitch again. You should be able to test it by enabling the killswitch, then connecting to the VPN. Once connected, check your IP to verify you are properly connected, then simply disconnect from the VPN. If the killswitch is working properly, then you should be unable to access your internet."

          There are a couple of common causes that can prevent the Kill switch from working, the first is if you have more than one Network adapter enabled. Can you confirm if you have more than one network on your system (like a wireless card and an ethernet card)? If so, can you make sure the one you don't normally use is disabled please? Use the following instructions to disable and extra Network cards:
          
          1. Click the Apple icon in the top left corner, and choose System Preferences
          2. Click Network
          3. Select the unused network adapter in the list on the left hand side of the window
          4. Click the gear shaped Settings icon below the list of adapters
          5. Select Make Service Inactive
          6. Click Apply, close the window, and test the killswitch again.
          
          If the issues persist, another possible cause is that there may be a security software interfering with the script Killswitch to function. Please try adding the following folder as an exception to your antivirus software:
          
          ~/.pia_manager
          
          This will exclude all components of the VPN software from your security. After this, please do a full uninstall and reinstall using the steps listed on the following article. This will ensure that you're using the latest update, and if it is cause by a permissions issue this will help resolve it: 
          
          https://support.privateinternetaccess.com/Knowledgebase/Article/View/111
          
          Once completed test the killswitch again. If the issue persists after this, then at this point in order to continue troubleshooting, we will need some more information. Please use the following instructions to obtain and submit your debug log:
           
              1. Click on the icon in the Menu bar and choose Disconnect
              2. Click on the icon again and choose Settings 
              3. Click on the Advanced button.
              4. Click into the Local Port box.
              5. Hit CTRL+L on your keyboard.
              6. You'll see a window pop up, asking to send a debug log, along with a 3-digit ID.
              7. Send the debug log to us, and let us know what the ID number is."

          "Hello,
          
          Thank you for contacting us.
          
          It seems that your VPN software is not generating the file needed to make the killswitch work. What I would like you to try is to manually create the file, and see if that gets the killswitch working for you:
           
           1. Locate Notepad on your computer. Right click Notepad, and choose Run as administrator.
           2. Now locate Command Prompt on your computer, and open it.
           3. In Command Prompt, type ipconfig
           4. Press Enter
           5. Scroll to the top of the information that appeared, and look for the IPv4 address. Below that you should see your subnet mask, and below that, you should see your default gateway. The default gateway is what we need.
           
           5.1 See the attached Default Gateway screenshot in the following dropbox link below for an example.
           
           https://www.dropbox.com/s/4kewdoqk4a0hzbc/Win-DefaultGateway.png
           
           6. Once you have retrieved the Default Gateway, go back to Notepad, and paste the following there: {"killswitch":true,"saved_default_gateway":"x.x.x.x","saved_openvpn_gateway":null,"standard_route_removed":true,"watching_standard_route":true}
           7. Replace the x.x.x.x in the line above with your Default Gateway. It should look similar to {"killswitch":true,"saved_default_gateway":"192.168.65.1","saved_openvpn_gateway":null,"standard_route_removed":true,"watching_standard_route":true} when you are finished, but with your Default Gateway in place of the 192.168.65.1.
           8. Click File in Notepad, and click Save. In the Save window, navigate to your Program Files (not Program Files x86) folder, and locate the pia_manager folder.
           9. Open the pia_manager folder, then open the Data folder contained within.
           10. Name the file killswitch_state.json and click Save.
           
           Now try the killswitch again. You should be able to test it by enabling the killswitch, then connecting to the VPN. Once connected, check your IP to verify you are properly connected, then simply disconnect from the VPN. If the killswitch is working properly, then you should be unable to access your internet."

          Thank you for contacting us.
          
          If the killswitch appears not to be working, there are a couple of common causes for this:
          
          - Do you have more than one network adapter on your system, such as both a wireless card and an Ethernet card? If so, please make sure the one you don't normally use is disabled. You can use the following instructions to disable any extra network cards:
          
          Go to Start > Control Panel > Device Manager
          Click on Network Adapters
          Right click on the Network Adapter you do not use (i.e. if you connect using WiFi, disable the Ethernet card, and if you connect with an Ethernet cable, disable the wireless card. DO NOT disable the TAP adapter).
          
          This will give you a warning that the device will stop functioning. Click OK.
          
          - If the above does not resolve your issue, another possible cause of killswitch failure is security software interference. Please add the following exceptions to any security applications or firewalls you may be running, to prevent them from impeding the functionality of our application:
          
          C:/Program Files/pia_manager/openVPN.exe
          C:/Program Files/pia_manager/pia_manager.exe
          C:/Program Files/pia_manager/tapinstall.exe
          C:/Program Files/pia_manager/installer_win.exe
          C:/Program Files/pia_manager/pia_tray/pia_tray.exe
          C:/Program Files/pia_manager/pia-openvpn.dll
          C:/Windows/system32/DRIVERS/tap0901.sys
          
          A reboot and reinstallation may be required to establish these security changes; please use the following instructions to reinstall the VPN software:
          
          https://support.privateinternetaccess.com/Knowledgebase/Article/View/32
          
          
          If you are still unable to use the killswitch successfully, please use the following instructions to obtain and submit your debug log:
          
              1. Right click on the icon in the system tray and choose Disconnect.
              2. Right click on the icon again and choose Settings
              3. Click on the Advanced button.

        "Hello,
        
        Thank you for contacting us.
        
        The error message you are seeing when installing the PIA Linux Beta Client on Ubuntu (and it's variants) is due to two missing dependencies (libgcrypt11 and libgnutls26) not included in newer versions of Ubuntu. To attempt to resolve this issue, download the following files:
        
        For 32 Bit versions of Ubuntu download the following files:
        https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+archive/primary/+files/libgcrypt11_1.5.3-2ubuntu4.2_i386.deb
        http://launchpadlibrarian.net/176785069/libgnutls26_2.12.23-15ubuntu2_i386.deb
        
        For 64 bit versions of Ubuntu download the following files:
        https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+archive/primary/+files/libgcrypt11_1.5.3-2ubuntu4.2_amd64.deb
        http://launchpadlibrarian.net/176785194/libgnutls26_2.12.23-15ubuntu2_amd64.deb
        
        If you are unsure which version of Ubuntu you are using, simply run the following command from Terminal:
        uname –m
        
        If you are running 64 bit, the output will read x86_64, and 32-bit systems will read i686 (or i386).
        
        Once you have determined what version you are using, install the two corresponding .deb files. (DO NOT INSTALL ALL FOUR)
        For ease of installation, you can choose to install the GDebi Package Installer from Software Center to minimize the use of Terminal:
        
        Browse to the download location of the .deb files, right click and open with GDebi Package Installer. Once the .deb files are opened with GDebi Package Installer, you will be prompted for your root password. 
        
        After both .deb packages are installed, you should now be able to run the PIA Linux Beta Client."

      - Inst - Win - Ruby Failure
        "Hello,
        
        Thank you for contacting us.
        
        What your program is detecting is called rubyw.exe. This is the process that executes all the ruby scripting in our application, that allows it to run. However, we designed it to install to a randomized temporary directory on each launch, along with a randomized filename, to ensure no one can locate it, and thus crack it (while it's running, it contains your login information and binds your local IP, which would be a major security risk if it became visible externally; thus why we randomize it's name and location, so it can't be found by automatic scripts/etc). 
        
        However, this randomization causes security software to be unable to recognize it. Security software operates off of a predefined list of allowed apps, called a definition file. If it sees anything that's not on that list (even custom apps like ours), it will state that it's untrusted, and immediately assumes it's not safe (since it doesn't know what it is). This is extremely common, and is why the app developers allow you a way to add your own exceptions for apps on your computer, to allow them to function when you know they're safe. 
        
        To do this for our app, you need to add the following files/programs to it's whitelist or allowed app list, which should keep it from interfering with the operation of our application in the future:

        Fortunately, it does not block most PPTP connections, so we recommend using a PPTP set-up to connect from China. 
        
        (Please note: the PPTP VPN option we offer is in no way reliably secure anymore, and should not be used unless absolutely necessary. It should only be considered as being equivalent to a SOCKS proxy, where you would have a masked IP, but no other reliable security is present. No inherent security beyond the changing of your IP should be assumed.
         
        However, although technically vulnerable, it would require someone with time and resources specifically focused on your data in order to breach a PPTP VPN. 
        
        That said, for maximum security and privacy, we strongly recommend using another VPN setup whenever possible.)
        
        To set-up a PPTP connection on your DD-WRT router, use the instructions below:
        
        1. Please log in to our Client Control panel, located at https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/pages/client-sign-in Once you are logged into the client control panel, click the Generate PPTP/L2TP/SOCKS5 username and password button. You will use this username and password for this connection.

        ***DO NOT PROCEED UNTIL STEP ONE HAS BEEN COMPLETED. YOUR USERNAME FOR A PPTP CONNECTION SHOULD LOOK SIMILAR TO x1234567***
        
        2. In DD-WRT, access the VPN tab found under the Services section.
        
        3. Enable the PPTP Client.
        
        4. Set the Server IP or DNS Name to an IP address for the VPN server you'd like to connect to. (Please refer to the following support article, for instructions to find an IP address for use in your manual connection: https://support.privateinternetaccess.com/Knowledgebase/Article/View/77 )

      - Setup - China - OSX 10.4 (PPTP)
        "Currently, connecting to a VPN in China is very difficult. The Great Firewall has been updated to seek out and block any VPN connections it can find.
        
        Fortunately, it does not block most PPTP connections, so we suggest using a PPTP set-up to connect from China. To do so, please use the instructions below:
        
        (Please note: the PPTP VPN option we offer is in no way reliably secure anymore, and should not be used unless absolutely necessary. It should only be considered as being equivalent to a SOCKS proxy, where you would have a masked IP, but no other reliable security is present. No inherent security beyond the changing of your IP should be assumed.
         
        However, although technically vulnerable, it would require someone with time and resources specifically focused on your data in order to breach a PPTP VPN. 
        
        That said, for maximum security and privacy, we strongly recommend using another VPN setup whenever possible. However, for OSX 10.4, there is no other option for use in China)
        
        This configuration uses a specially generated PPTP/L2TP/SOCKS5 username and password; if you have not generated this yet, please log in to our client area, located at https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/pages/client-sign-in using your current username and password. Once logged in, click the Generate password button. This will provide a username that starts with an "x" and a new password. Use this username and password for PPTP, L2TP, or SOCKS5 connections.
         
        If you are unable to access our website, please contact us, and we will send this special login directly to your email.
        
        - Go to Applications and open Internet Connect
        - In the Internet Connect application, click File -> New VPN Connection
        - In the next prompt, select PPTP and click Continue
        - In the VPN (PPTP) window, make sure Configuration is set to ‘Other’
        - *For Server address, enter the IP address for the server locale you wish to. Please refer to the server list and directions below for obtaining this information
        - In the Account Name field, enter your  "x" username (as per above)
        - In the Password field, enter your generated "x" password (as per above)
        - Select Show VPN status in menu bar (optional)
        - Click Connect to activate the VPN connection
        
        When you want to connect/disconnect the VPN, you can either use the status icon in the menu bar if selected, or return to “Internet Connect” and click on “VPN (PPTP)” to access the connection status.

        Our PIA client software is currently only compatible with Mac OSX 10.8 and up. Other VPN options must be used for OSX 10.7 and under.
        
        We actually support two alternate OpenVPN based set-up for OSX, Tunnelblick, and Viscosity. Both programs work well, with some minor differences. These can sometimes work when our OpenVPN-based PIA client VPN does not.
        
        There are two options for set-up: Tunnelblick, and Viscosity.
        
        Tunnelblick is a free program developed by Google. Because it is free, it is not updated as frequently as a paid program, and there may be some delays waiting for compatibility with newer operating systems. Tunnelblick currently supports OSX 10.4 and up.
        
        https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/pages/client-support/#macosx_openvpn
        
        Viscosity is a program developed by a company called Spark Labs. It has a 30 day free trial, then requires the one-time purchase of a license. The trade-off for this Viscosity is updated much more quickly and is always ready to go with even the newest operating systems. Viscosity currently supports OSX 10.5 and up.
        
        https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/pages/client-support/#macosx_viscosity
        
        Other than these OpenVPN based VPN options, you could also use L2TP, which is a feature built into most operating systems as an optional means of VPN use:

        Tunnelblick is a free program developed by Google. Because it is free, it is not updated as frequently as a paid program, and there may be some delays waiting for compatibility with newer operating systems. Tunnelblick currently supports OSX 10.4 and up.
        
        https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/pages/client-support/#macosx_openvpn
        
        Viscosity is a program developed by a company called Spark Labs. It has a 30 day free trial, then requires the one-time purchase of a license. The trade-off for this Viscosity is updated much more quickly and is always ready to go with even the newest operating systems. Viscosity currently supports OSX 10.5 and up.

        The directions for router based VPN setups for these firmware can be found on this page: https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/pages/client-support/
         
        In all likelihood, you will need to install ("flash") such custom router firmware onto your router. Please note that router flashing falls outside our support scope, and doing so would be at your own discretion and liability.
         
        It may be possible to configure VPN use on stock or other firmware, provided it has VPN configuration options, but we would not have a ready guide for its use. You could either try to find help with such a setup on the PIA forum:

          "Hello,
          
          Thank you for contacting us.
          
          Currently, connecting to a VPN in China is very difficult. The Great Firewall has been updated to seek out an block any VPN connections it can find.
          
          Fortunately, it does not block most PPTP connections, so we recommend using a PPTP set-up to connect from China. To set-up a PPTP connection on your Windos 10 pc, use the instructions below:
          
          Before starting, for PPTP connections you will need to use the PPTP/L2TP/SOCKS5 username and its password. 
          Please log in to our client area, located at https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/pages/client-sign-in using your current username and password. Once logged in, click the Generate password button. This will provide a username that starts with an """"""""x"""""""" and a new password. Use this username and password for PPTP, L2TP, or SOCKS5 connections. (Use the username that starts with """"""""p"""""""" for OpenVPN connections like our client.)
          
          Next follow our guide below for DD-WRT PPTP:

      - Setup - Win - OpenVPN Connect on Startup
        "Hello,
        
        Thank you for contacting us.
        
        If you wish to have your OpenVPN connection start on boot:
        
        First, go to C:/Program Files/OpenVPN/configs. Here you'll see the various configuration files you have setup to connect to the service. Pick one that you'd like to auto-connect to, then right-click on it, go to Open With, and choose Notepad (if Notepad is not present on your system, you can select any other text editing program).
        
        Next, find the line that says "auth-user-pass ", and change it to the following:
        
        auth-user-pass auth.txt
        
        Once this has been edited, go to File -> Save As, and enter the name "OpenVPN_Auto.ovpn", and save the document. Next, in the same configs directory, right-click in the window, and choose New -> Text Document. Name it auth.txt, then open it. Here, enter only your username and password for our service, with your username on the first line, and the password on the second. For example, if your username was p1234567 and your password was 12345678, you'd enter it as follows:
        
        p1234567
        12345678
        
        Once done, save the change, and it will automatically log into that config file without prompting for a username or password.
        
        The next step is to add a task to Windows, so it will load the OpenVPN application, and automatically connect to the config file you've just edited. To do this, go to Start, and in the Search bar, search for Task Scheduler. Open that, then go to the Action menu at the top, and choose "Create Basic Task". This will begin a setup wizard for the new task; please follow the steps below to create it:
        
        1) In the "Name" field, enter "OpenVPN for PIA", then click Next.
        2) Select "When I log on", then click Next.
        3) Select "Start a program", then click Next.
        4) Click the Browse button, and navigate to C:/Program Files/OpenVPN/bin, and choose "openvpn-gui.exe".
        5) In the "Add arguements" box, enter the following: --connect "OpenVPN_Auto.ovpn"
        6) Click Next, enable the option "Open the Properties dialog for this task when I click Finish", then click Finish.
        7) In the new window, on the General tab, enable "Run with the highest privileges"
        8) Go to the Triggers tab, select the listed "At log on" trigger, and click Edit.
        9) Enable the option "Delay task", set it to 30 seconds, then click Ok.
        10) Go to the Conditions tab, and disable the option "Start the task only if the computer is on AC power".
        11) Go to the Settings tab, and enable the options "Run task as soon as possible after a scheduled start is missed", and "If the task fails, restart every", then set it to 1 minute, and 5 times.
        12) Click Ok.
        
        After this, reboot your computer, and approximately 30 seconds after your computer boots (to give everything time to fully load, so nothing interferes with OpenVPN trying to connect), it should automatically load OpenVPN, and connect to the server you chose in the config file you edited prior. This should now happen each time you log into your computer in the future."

        - Go into C:\Program Files\pia_manager\data
        - Make a copy of region_data.txt in the same directory, and rename it to region_override.txt
        - Go into region_override.txt and change the server address to whatever you'd like it to be (a full list of our gateways can be found here: https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/pages/network/
        - Exit and relaunch the PIA application.
        
        From then on, it will connect using only the IP address you've specified in the override file. If you ever want to disable this, you'd just have to rename the region_override.txt file to something like region_override.old, and once you relaunch the app again, it will use the original file like it did before."

          (Please note: the PPTP VPN option we offer is in no way reliably secure anymore, and should not be used unless absolutely necessary. It should only be considered as being equivalent to a SOCKS proxy, where you would have a masked IP, but no other reliable security is present. No inherent security beyond the changing of your IP should be assumed.
           
          However, although technically vulnerable, it would require someone with time and resources specifically focused on your data in order to breach a PPTP VPN.

    - Speed - Explain/Get Speedtest Info
      "Hello,
      
      Thank you for contacting us.
      
      Your ISP rated connection speed is based on connections to the ISP network under ideal conditions. However, VPN connections incur additional overhead due to the encryption process; using higher levels encryption would slow the conncetion even more. This can certainly be further reduced by connecting to gateways that have additional routing latency or have a lot of traffic on them at the time.
      
      You can expect to see at least a 10-15%* speed drop from the results you get when testing "disconnected" to our servers on our network page here: https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/pages/network/
      
      Again, this is only under IDEAL conditions. Typically the difference could be more like between 15-50% for computers and 25-75% drop for routers.
      
      Here are the steps to get the baseline raw speeds between your computer and our servers:
      
      1) Disconnect from the VPN now
      2) Go to https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/pages/network/
      3) Click on and run some of the "Speed Test" links to the right of the servers
      4) Record name of the server and the results you tested as follows:
      
          Example...
          "US East" = 12 Mbps (No VPN)
          "US West" = 16 Mbps (No VPN)
          "CA Toronto" = 14 Mbps (No VPN)
          "CA North York" = 10 Mbps (No VPN)
          Etc.
      
      Please test as many of the servers as you can including the ones that are physically the closest to you.
      
      Once we have the baseline raw speeds from your computer via your ISP to our servers we can move forward with understanding what to expect.  If necessary we can then adjust some settings to get the best speeds possible or troubleshoot further if necessary."
    - Speed - Get Info
      "Hello,
      
      Thank you for contacting us.
      
      In order to help better assist you, I'll need a few pieces of info from you:
      
      -  Where are you seeing the slow speeds exactly (torrents, etc)?
      -  What speeds are you actually seeing (with and without the VPN active)?
      -  How are you gauging your speeds?
      -  What gateway/server location are you using?

      -  What operating system are you running on your computer?
      -  Are you running any firewalls or other security software on your computer?
      -  How are you connecting to the internet (public wifi, you own router, an ISP's modem, etc)?
      -  How are you connecting to VPN (our PIA application, a manual setup, another application, etc)?"
    - Speed - Higher Encryption Rates
      "Hello,
      
      Thank you for contacting us.
      
      When you set the encyrption level higher than the defaults, it can slow speeds drastically or even halt them altogether as this will increase latency to our servers, as it is adding extra levels of encryption. 
      
      We recommend reverting the encryption settigns back to their default settings to reduce connection overhead.
      
      For more information about our encryption, please visit our site:
      
      https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/pages/vpn-encryption"
    - Speed - Torrents
      "Hello,
      
      Thank you for contacting us.
      
      Torrents are unique in how the tech works, in comparison to FTP or P2P. To download a torrent, you connect to a tracker, which contains a listing within it's swarm of seeds and peers. Each seed and peer uses a torrent application to feed the torrent to the swarm. However, approximately 4 in 5 torrent clients block anonymous inbound connections, and thus prevent you from connecting to them to feed from them. There is no way around this, and its entirely dependent on what torrent clients seeds/peers happen to be using within any given tracker. As such, you'd rarely see more than maybe 20-40% of your normal speeds while connected to any anonymous connection in torrents, due to this fact.
      
      With that said, this likely isn't the sole cause of speed or connectivity issues in torrents. This is a very common issue with torrent programs; many require port forwarding to be enabled, in order for them to work correctly (uTorrent, for example). While we can't help you configure your torrent client, we can certainly tell you how to get the port information you need to configure it.
      
      The only way to get a port assigned for use with your torrent client is to use our application to connect. You need to right-click on the Private Internet Access application in your system tray, and choose Settings, then click Advanced. Put a checkmark in Port Forwarding, save it, and connect to one of the port forwarding-capable servers:
      
      - CA Toronto
      - CA North York
      - Netherlands
      - Switzerland
      - Sweden
      - France
      - Germany
      - Russia
      - Romania
      - Israel
      
      While connected to one of these gateways, wait approximately 30-60 seconds, then hover over the PIA application's icon in your system tray; you'll get a small tool-tip window come up, which will include a port number. This randomly-assigned port is what you need to enter into your torrent client, to get it to function correctly.
      
      In addition to using port forwarding, you can also try changing the ports the VPN uses to connect; this can help with a variety of issues, including improving overall connection speed: https://support.privateinternetaccess.com/KnowledgeBase/Article/View/87"
    - DroidOS
      - Speed - Droid - App
        "Hello,
        
        Thank you for contacting us.
        
        Speed issues are common with any VPN service due to the encryption and routing utilized, however there are many things that can be done to improve the speeds you're seeing. Please provide more info on your current setup:
        
        -  Where are you seeing the slow speeds exactly (torrents, etc)?
        -  What speeds are you actually seeing (with and without the VPN active)?
        -  How are you gauging your speeds?
        -  What gateway/server location are you using?
        -  What country/state are you located in?
        -  What version of DroidOS are you running on your device?
        -  Are you running any firewalls or other security software on your device?
        -  How are you connecting to the internet (public wifi/cell data, you own router, an ISP's modem, etc)?
        
        Issues like this can often be caused by the ports the VPN is trying to connect over being blocked. Changing those ports can resolve this issue. Use the following instructions to change the ports in our app:
        
        Open the app, tap the settings button in the top right corner of the app screen
        Tap the Remote port option.
        Try changing the remote port to 1194, and try connecting. 
        If that does not work, change the port to 9201, and try connecting. 
        If that does not work, change the port to 8080, and try connecting. 
        If that does not work, change the ports to 53, and try again. 
        
        If none of those work, enable a TCP connection by checking the box for Use TCP.  Try connecting to remote port 443.

        "Hello,
        
        Sometimes, speed issues can be caused by latency or a bad hop on the route to the server you are connecting to, or the site you are trying to visit. The best way to determine this is with an MTR test.
        
        An MTR test is a broad-spectrum diagnostic that can identify where connections are failing, and may identify what's causing your connection to fail. Please note that MTR tests can only be run on Windows, Mac OSX, or Linux. However, as the test being done is to assess your network, not specific devices, the device used to run the test is not relevant to the result. Also, please ensure you run the test while using the specific ISP network that is at issue.
        
        With the MTR test, here are the steps you will need to use:
        
        1. DISCONNECT the VPN
        - Open Terminal (this program is located in Applications>>Utilities)
        - Maximize Terminal window
        - Enter this command at the prompt: sudo /usr/local/sbin/mtr www.google.com
        - Run the MTR test for 100 cycles (Press "P" to pause when you see the count reach 100+ in the Snt column)
        - On your keyboard, press Command + Shift + 4 and then release all keys. This will take a screenshot of the results and save it on your desktop
        - Press "Q" to quit
        
        2. Enter this command at the prompt: sudo /usr/local/sbin/mtr us-east.privateinternetaccess.com
        
        , but replace us-east.privateinternetaccess.com with the server you prefer to connect to. A list of the hostnames for our servers can be found here: https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/pages/network/ 
        
        - Take a screenshot of this test result
        
        3. CONNECT the VPN
        - Enter this command at the prompt: sudo /usr/local/sbin/mtr www.google.com
        - Take a screenshot of this test result
        
        Label each screenshot accordingly (e.g. To Google VPN OFF, etc.), and please attach these files to your reply."

        At this point, we'll need you to try running a test with a utility called MTR.  This utility is a broad-spectrum diagnostic that can identify where connections are failing, and may identify what's causing your connection to fail.
        
        With the MTR test, here are the steps you will need to use.
        
        * Note: Disconnect from the VPN before you start the following steps.
        
        1. Open Terminal (this program is located in Applications>>Utilities)

        - Then press the Enter key - [Please let the count get to at least 100 in the snt column]
        4. On your keyboard, press Command + Shift + 4 and then release all keys. (This will take a screenshot of the results and save it on your desktop and name it "Disconnected-mtr-google")
        5. Next, click on Shell at the top and click on New Command
        (* Choose a server name to replace "servernamehere" = the server you are connecting too IE: us-east.privateinternetaccess.com)
        6. In the window that opens, type in the following...
        sudo /usr/local/sbin/mtr servernamehere
        - Then press the Enter key - [Please let the count get to at least 100 in the snt column]
        7. On your keyboard, press Command + Shift + 4 and then release all keys. (This will take a screenshot of the results and save it on your desktop and name it "Disconnected-mtr-servernamehere")
        8. Connect to the VPN
        9. Next, click on Shell at the top and click on New Command
        10. Type the following...
        sudo /usr/local/sbin/mtr www.google.com
        - Then press the Enter key - [Please let the count get to at least 100 in the snt column]
        11. To take a screenshot, on your keyboard, press Command + Shift + 4 and then release all keys. (This will take a screenshot of the results and save it on your desktop and name it "Connected-mtr-google")
        
        You have now completed the MTR.  Please attach the screenshots to the ticket and send them to us.

        "Hello,
        
        Thank you for contacting us.
        
        Router VPN setups are by nature considerably slower than computer based ones, due to the encryption that secure VPN services utilizes. Routers typically lack the hardware capability to process the encryption in real-time, causing connection lag.
        
        For example, you may be using a router that's considered a fairly good router by today's standards. However, even with a 700mhz processor, and 256mb of RAM, those are specs you might have seen on a high-end Windows 98/ low-end WinXP computer, 10-15 years ago. Basically, it's trying to run modern technology on hardware that can barely support it. 
        
        The only reason one should use a router based VPN setup is (a) to connect devices that do not support VPN installation (TVs, gaming consoles, etc.) or (b) to connect more than 5 devices simultaneously. If you are concerned with speed, you should avoid using a router VPN setup.
        
        That said, I can suggest trying to tweak your MTU setting a bit; typically, if you lower it slightly, it makes it easier for the router to handle it, and in fact increases your speeds. Try reducing your MTU to around 1400 or so (pretty much any level between 1350 -1450), and hopefully it will help.
        
        Next, please try using the following ports and protocols for your OpenVPN client: 
        
        UDP 9201, 1194, 8080, 53 
        TCP 80, 110, 443 
        
        Finally, try using an IP instead of a hostname in the Server Address field, to avoid any DNS resolution issues, which can help speed up the connection somewhat. To obtain an IP address from our servers, please open Command Prompt or a Terminal Window and type: 
        
        ping (hostname of server you want IPs for. A list of our servers can be found here: https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/pages/network/ )
        
        and hit enter. You should get an IP address for the hostname you put in. 
        
        A reboot of the router may necessary to activate any changes made in your router settings."

        You can expect to see at least anywhere from 10-25% speed drop from the results you get when testing to our server on our network page here: https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/pages/network/  
        
        Note: Please run the speed tests without the VPN active, to gauge your raw speed to that server) 
        Note: This is under ideal conditions. The higher encryption that you use, the more overhead that would be added slowing the connection. This can certainly be worsened by connecting to Gateways that have additional routing latency or have a lot of traffic on them at the time.
        
        Issues like this can often be caused by the ports the VPN is trying to connect over being blocked. Changing those ports can resolve this issue. Use the following instructions to change the ports in our app:
        
        1. Click on our icon in the System Tray or Menu Bar
        2. Disconnect from the VPN.
        3. Right click the icon for the VPN again, and click on Settings
        4. Click on the Advanced button
        5. If the Connection type is set to TCP, change it to UDP. If it already says UDP, do not make any changes to this setting yet.
        6. Change the remote port to 9201, click Save, and reconnect. See if 
        the issue persists.
        6.1 If the issue persists, disconnect from the VPN, change the remote port to 1194, save, and reconnect. See if the issue persists.
        6.2 If the issue persists, disconnect from the VPN, change the remote port to 8080, save, and reconnect. See if the issue persists.
        6.3 If the issue persists, disconnect from the VPN, change the remote port to 53, save, and reconnect. See if the issue persists.
        7. If this does not help, please go back to the Advanced Settings
        8. Disconnect from the VPN, and change the protocol to TCP
        9. Change the remote port to 80, click Save, and reconnect. See if the issue persists.
        10.1 If the issue persists, disconnect from the VPN, change the remote port to 110, save, and reconnect. See if the issue persists.
        10.2 If the issue persists, disconnect from the VPN, change the remote port to 443, save, and reconnect. See if the issue persists.
        11. If you have been unable to connect this far, set the local port option to 53, and try each of the settings above again.

        - T2 - Speed - Win - Half-Duplex
          "If your speed is always limited to 10Mbps when the VPN is connected then it's likely that there is an issue with the virtual adapter having the wrong half-duplex speed set. 
          
          Your Ethernet likely uses full-duplex connections, but it also has a default half-duplex setting. Our virtual adapter only runs in half-duplex mode. It inherits the half-duplex speed from the real network adapter. To check this setting, please:
          
          1. Go into your Start Menu, choose Run... and type:
          ncpa.cpl
          into the search box and press enter 
          2. In the Network Connections window that appears, locate the Ethernet/WiFi network adapter you connect to the internet with. DO NOT make these changes to the TAP connection
          3. Right click and press Properties 
          4. Under the Networking tab, Click Configure.
          5. Click the Advanced tab.
          6. In the Property list, click the property that corresponds to the connection type, such as Connection Type, Duplex Mode, Media, Media Type, or Link Speed & Duplex, depending on the adapter's attributes.
          In the Value list, click 100Mbps Half Duplex.
          7. Click OK.
          
          To make sure the VPN's virtual adapter correctly accepts these settings please use the following instructions to reinstall the VPN software:

        - T2 - Speed - Win - Half-Duplex Hardware
          "OpenVPN coded the virtual adapter's driver to function at only half-duplex; thus, if you're using an older network card and/or a router without a Gigabit Ethernet capability,  or connecting via Wifi without 802.11n capability, then the absolute maximum you'll be able to receive is 10mbps. Other than upgrading your hardware, the only way around this is to not use OpenVPN or our app, and instead use a simple, manual connection, such as L2TP. 
          
          We're sorry for any inconvenience this may cause."

          "If your system is issuing persistent UAC (User Account Control) prompts, despite running with full admin rights, your only immediate recourse would be to turn off UAC. If you do not wish to disable that security feature, an alternative could be to exempt our software specifically from UAC blocks. There isn't a way to grant such execution rights directly with Windows, but there is a service available from Microsoft called the Microsoft Application Compatibility Toolkit, which has the ability to allow you to grant specific applications exemption from UAC. Here's a guide on a tech forum outlining how to accomplish that: http://superuser.com/questions/99286/selectively-disabling-uac-for-specific-programs-on-windows-7
