# PIA ZD Scripts

These are various scripts written to integrate with ZD and to give us extra needed functionality from Zendesk.

These scripts use the [zdesk](https://github.com/fprimex/zdesk/) and its' dependencies.

Most of these are written by Daniel <doaks@londontrustmedia.com>, so feel free to yell at me if you need any help.


## Usage

Define the following environment variables:

* `ZD_URL`: URL for the ZD instance, e.g. `https://company.zendesk.com`
* `ZD_USER`: Username (email addy) you're logging into that instance with.
* `ZD_PASS`: Password you're logging into that instance with.
